# Participate_into_Chinese_Politic_as_a_citizen
作为市民参政议政，你不参与，我不参与，那就会被代表，那就会被宰割，不要仅仅抱怨压迫，都是自找的。

July 24 2020  Call the local 12345 political hotline, asked to public all the representitives' resume, photo and email. If this is done, I guess some of the reresentitives want me die. Whatever, I don't think live doing nothing is a real life though, death is not that fear to me. This is not some personal benefit requirement, but a system rule leve chaning to benefit the whole society, which they fear the mostly. 

July 24 2020  10 minutes later, I received a call that told me how to "apply for make something public" , yes there is such channel on the website, but I changed my requirement to be "want an explanation why the gov chose to hide the detail information of representitives".

Aug 6 2020, Well, I didn't receive any call back from the 12345, good, very good.
